-- | Set up the OpenGL context, clear the buffer, and render the given picture
--   into it. 
--
--   This is the same as `renderPicture` composed with `withModelview`
--   and `withClearBuffer`. If you want to manage your own OpenGL context then
--   you can just call `renderPicture`. 
--
--   Using this function assumes that you've already opened a window
--   and set that to the active context. If you don't want to do your own window
--   management then use the @gloss@ package instead.
